## üìù Notes

- **Pie Menu Icons**: Fixed the issue where pie menu wasn't showing icons. The problem was that the pie menu was always showing 8 slices, but only 4 had commands assigned. Now it dynamically shows only the slices that have commands, making the icons visible.
- **App Detection**: Enhanced app detection with partial name matching to better identify apps like Figma.
- **Dynamic Slices**: Pie menu now adapts to show only the number of slices needed based on assigned commands.
- **Splash Screen**: Added a professional splash screen that displays for 4 seconds when the app launches, showing the MacPie logo, app name, version, and an animated loading indicator with "Starting" text.
